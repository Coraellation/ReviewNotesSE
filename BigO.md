### Linked List

Operation | Complexity | Why
----------|------------|-----
Print     | O(N)       |All nodes are visited
Insert (sorted)    | O(N) |Going through all nodes
Insert (unsorted) | O(1) | Can just add to front
Reverse| O(N)| Going through all nodes
FindMax (sorted) |O(1) | It's the first element
Find Max (unsorted) | O(N) | Max can be the last node
